# A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game against your computer
Did this for a little practice and to spend a few distracted hours! Got the idea from a screenshot at frontend mentor and did it from there. Might be different or the same as the original challenge, I don't know since I only looked at the first screenshot.

# Play at
https://ddandev.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

## Features!
Just pick your play and click or tap it. Your computer or phone will make a pick too.
Then you will see who wins and can play again.
Scores are kept at the top of the page and can be reset by a button at the bottom right.

The whole thing scales to any screen size. 

## Next improvements:
1- Add button to display to the user the random generator tester that already exists in the js code. (Remove the tinfoil hat when a score of 5 x 20 is upsetting...... but it happens)

2- Animate the transitions between each game state!

3- Make it possible to play with two human players, each making their choices with a configurable set of keyboard buttons. A choice not made within a very short delay after the first one doesn't trigger the play result so the hoomans must count down and choose at the same time.
