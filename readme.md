# A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game against your computer
Did this for a little practice and to spend a few distracted hours! Got the idea from a screenshot at frontend mentor and did it from there. Might be different or the same as the original challenge, I don't know since I only looked at the first screenshot.

# Play at
https://ddandev.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

## Features!
Just pick your play and click or tap it. Your computer or phone will make a pick too.
Then you will see who wins and can play again.
Scores are kept at the top of the page and can be reset by a button at the bottom right.

The whole thing scales to any screen size. 

## Next improvements:
1- When scores go double digit, the header goes a bit too wide for mobile.

2- Might have a bit of a vertical scrolling to see the reset button at the bottom if the screen is very wide and very short vertically. In this case the total height of the entire page also changes between each state of the game (choosing vs result).

3- Remove ugly "selecting" boxes when tapping on mobile.

4- Add button to display to the user the random generator tester that already exists in the js code. (Remove the tinfoil hat when a score of 5 x 20 is upsetting...... but it happens)

5- Both numbers in the scoreboard should have an appropriate indication of whose score is which. Left one is the players, right one is the computer's

6- Animate the transitions between each game state!

7- Make it possible to play with two human players, each making their choices with a configurable set of keyboard buttons. A choice not made within a very short delay after the first one doesn't trigger the play result so the hoomans must count down and choose at the same time.
